## How the AI Works

This app uses AI-style logic (no live LLM calls):

- Parses ingredients with lightweight rules
- Chooses recipe profiles and methods from curated templates
- Applies diet swaps for Vegan, Vegetarian, Keto, and Gluten Free
- Suggests substitutions from a curated ingredient catalog
- Adds randomized variations for freshness
- Styles responses with Anthony Edwards or LeBron James personas
- Includes prompt-hacking defenses (refusal + redirect) for unsafe requests

## 🧑‍🍳 Usage

1. Choose a mode: Recipe Generator, Ingredient Substitute, or Meal Planner.
2. Enter ingredients or a question.
3. Adjust settings in the sidebar for servings, skill level, diet, and persona.
4. Use **Regenerate** for a fresh recipe with the same ingredients.
5. In the **AI Chatbot Demo**, compare the **before vs after** prompt outputs.

## 💬 Chat Personas

The chat is now powered by two special personas:

- **Anthony Edwards**
- **LeBron James**

Each response is tagged with a persona for a fun, lively feel.

## 🛡️ Prompt Hacking Defenses

The app includes a **before/after** demo that shows how prompt-hacking defenses work:

- **Before:** midterm prompt with no defenses
- **After:** defended prompt that refuses prompt injection and redirects to cooking help

Defenses include:
- Instruction hierarchy (system > developer > user)
- Untrusted input framing (user input is data, not instructions)
- Prompt injection / data exfiltration refusal
- Role and output-format lock
- Capability limits (no web/tool claims)
- Safe redirect to cooking tasks
